## Motivation
I got the idea for FootySpace from Google's own football results function. In Google Search, typing something like "La Liga results" would give you a nice little table containing the latest La Liga match results, and a link to each match's highlights on Youtube. However, one thing that I found mildly annoying is that I have to go back to Google Search & search for "Premier League results" if I want to get the Premier League match results & highlights. So my solution to this problem is to build a website which aggregates all the latest match results from the top 5 European leagues.
